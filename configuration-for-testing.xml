<!--

    In order to add your own test Frogans address(es) in the configuration
    file, please follow the guidelines below.

    Note: In the configuration file, no spaces are allowed at the start or the
    end of either an attribute value or the text characters in an element.


    <frogans-player-configuration-for-testing> element
    ==================================================

        The <frogans-player-configuration-for-testing> element represents the
        root element of the configuration file.

        This element has no attributes.

        This element contains between 1 and 16 <test-frogans-site> child
        elements.


    <test-frogans-site> element
    ===========================

        The <test-frogans-site> element represents a Frogans site associated
        with a test Frogans address.

        This element has one mandatory attribute "address" representing the
        Frogans address. The attribute value is in the 'network-name*site-name'
        pattern where:
            - 'network-name' is 'test'
            - 'site-name' can contain up to 28 ASCII characters in the range
              from 'a' to 'z', from '0' to '9' inclusive, and the '-' character
              (no spaces allowed)
              'site-name' is compliant with the IFAP specification version 1.1
              (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/ifap/access.html). As a
              result of section 4.4. concerning connector characters:
              - '-' cannot be the first nor the last character of 'site-name'
              - Two or more consecutive '-' cannot be included in 'site-name'

        This element contains 3 child elements: <frogans-site-root-directory>,
            <fsdl-documents> and <home-slide-file>.


    <frogans-site-root-directory> element
    =====================================

        The <frogans-site-root-directory> element represents the Frogans site
        root directory.

        This element has no attributes.

        This element contains one <ucsr-path> child element.


    <ucsr-path> element
    ===================

        The <ucsr-path> element represents the UCSR path to the server hosting
        the test Frogans site, as described in the UCSR specification
        (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/ucsr/access.html).

        This element has one mandatory attribute "network" representing the
        UCSR network on which the server hosting the Frogans site is available.
        The attribute value is currently either:
            - 'LOCAL' if the Frogans site is hosted on the local system
            - 'IP-DNS-TCP-HTTP' if the Frogans site is hosted on the Internet,
               using an HTTP server.

        If network='LOCAL', then this element contains two child elements:
        <platform> and <folder>.

            <platform> element
            ==================

            The <platform> element represents the local platform. This element
            has no attributes and only contains text characters. Possible
            values are: 'windows', 'macosx', or 'linux' depending on the local
            platform (respectively Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux).

            <folder> element
            ================

            The <folder> element represents the folder containing the Frogans
            site on the local platform. This element has no attributes and only
            contains text characters. Value can be either absolute or relative
            to the Frogans Player directory. On the Windows platform, the
            directory separator is '\'. On the Mac OS X and Linux platforms,
            the directory separator is '/'.

        If network='IP-DNS-TCP-HTTP', then this element contains four child
        elements: <location>, <domain-name>, <port>, and <directory>.

            <location> element
            ==================

            The <location> element represents the location of the server on the
            Internet. This element has no attributes and only contains text
            characters. The only possible value are: 'public' and 'private'
            depending on the location of the server. Note: when configuring a
            Frogans address of a public or a dedicated Frogans network, the
            only possible value is 'public'.

            <domain-name> element
            =====================

            The <domain-name> element represents the domain name of the server
            on the Internet. This element has no attributes and only contains
            text characters. The value contains between 6 and 128 characters.
            The value is a fully qualified domain name conforming to the
            'hostname' string defined in RFC 2396 (see RFC 2396, section 3.2.2.
            Server-based Naming Authority), but where the 'hostname' string can
            end with the '.' character. As a result, the 'domain' string does
            not contain a literal IPv4 address or a literal IPv6 address.

            <port> element
            ==============

            The <port> element element represents the TCP port of the server on
            the  Internet. This element has no attributes and only contains
            text characters. The value is an integer between 1 and 65535. Note:
            when configuring a Frogans address of a public or a dedicated
            Frogans network, the only possible value is 80.

            <directory> element
            ===================

            The <directory> element represents the path to the directory
            containing the Frogans site on the server on the Internet.
            This element has no attributes and only contains text characters.
            Value is path conforming to the 'path-absolute' string defined in
            RFC 3986 (see RFC 3986, section 3.3. Path), but where additional
            restrictions apply on the 'pchar' string. As a result, the value
            starts with, but may not end with a '/', and may contain
            subdirectories separated by '/'.


    <fsdl-documents> element
    ========================

        The <fsdl-documents> element represents the properties of the FSDL 
        documents of the Frogans site.

        This element has no attributes.

        This element contains 2 child elements: <version> and <encoding>.

            <version> element
            =================

            The <version> element represents the version of the FSDL
            specification used to develop the Frogans site. This element
            has no attributes and only contains text characters. The only
            possible value is currently: '3.0'.

            <encoding> element
            ==================

            The <encoding> element represents the method used to encode the
            FSDL documents of the Frogans site. This element has no attributes
            and only contains text characters. Possible values are: 'UTF-8' or
            'UTF-16'.


    <home-slide-file>Â element
    =========================

        The <home-slide-file> element represents the file, in the Frogans site
        root directory, corresponding to the home slide of the Frogans site.

        This element has no attributes and only contains text characters. The
        value conforms to the "name" attribute of the <file> element defined
        in the FSDL specification
        (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/fsdl/access.html).
